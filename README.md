Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The app utiliizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. MVC design pattern implemented. Node and MySQL query and route data in the app, and Handlebars generates the HTML.


How the app works:
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* The use may delete the burger to clear it from the screen.
